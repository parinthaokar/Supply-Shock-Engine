# ⚡ Global Supply Chain Ingestion & Dynamic Pricing Engine

During the 2021 semiconductor shortage, companies discovered their biggest vulnerability wasn't the supply disruption itself — it was that their pricing infrastructure couldn't react fast enough. Procurement teams were manually updating spreadsheets while margins eroded in real time. This project engineers the automated response they didn't have.

An end-to-end data engineering pipeline built with Python and MySQL that automates API data ingestion, tracks inventory through a normalized relational schema, simulates an East Asia supplier crisis, and dynamically reprices products using warehouse scarcity metrics.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project models a real-world macroeconomic disruption scenario. When a major supplier region experiences a shutdown, organizations must rapidly assess operational inventory levels and adjust pricing strategies to protect profit margins.

The system accomplishes this through a custom operational pipeline that:

1. **Ingests** external product data from a REST API into a raw JSON file.
2. **Seeds and standardizes** the data into a normalized MySQL database.
3. **Simulates a regional supply crisis** by altering supplier risk attributes.
4. **Triggers a dynamic pricing algorithm** based on inventory scarcity.
5. **Generates executive-level analytics** summarizing portfolio risk exposure.

## 🚀 System Features

### 🌍 REST API Data Ingestion

Built an automated ingestion script (`ingestion_products.py`) that:

* Connects to an external REST API
* Retrieves product datasets
* Filters unnecessary attributes
* Standardizes product metadata
* Writes structured JSON to a local landing zone

---

### 🗄️ Normalized Relational Database Design

Designed a normalized MySQL schema to preserve referential integrity and reduce data redundancy.

#### Products

Stores product identifiers, names, and pricing information.

#### Suppliers

Stores vendor metadata, regional classifications, and operational risk statuses.

#### Inventory

Maintains stock quantities while linking products and suppliers through foreign-key relationships.

This design enables efficient joins, scalable analytics, and strong relational consistency.

---

### ⚡ Event-Driven Crisis Simulation & Dynamic Pricing

The `simulate_supply_shock.py` module models a real-time supply chain disruption.

#### Crisis Simulation

* Identifies suppliers operating within the **East Asia** region.
* Updates supplier status to **Critical Shutdown**.
* Evaluates inventory availability across impacted products.

#### Dynamic Pricing Logic

Products are repriced according to inventory scarcity:

* Inventory < 150 units → **50% price increase**
* Inventory ≥ 150 units → **20% price increase**

#### Financial Precision

The pricing engine uses Python's `decimal.Decimal` type to eliminate floating-point precision errors during financial calculations.

#### Transaction Optimization

All pricing adjustments are processed in memory and committed through a single database transaction using:

```python
conn.commit()
```

This minimizes database overhead and ensures transactional consistency.

## 📊 Executive Analytics Layer

The analytics engine (`generate_analytics_report.py`) generates business intelligence metrics directly from the operational database.

Key metrics include:

* Total monitored products
* Regional inventory counts
* Portfolio value at risk
* Average warehouse stock levels

The reporting layer utilizes:

* Multi-table SQL joins
* Aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`)
* Regional grouping (`GROUP BY`)
* Inventory valuation calculations

## 🔒 Security Architecture

This project follows production-style credential management practices.

### Environment Variable Isolation

Database credentials are stored separately from application code using a local `.env` file.

```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=supply_chain_db
```

### Repository Protection

The repository includes a `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental exposure of credentials and local cache files.

```gitignore
.env
__pycache__/
*.pyc
```
